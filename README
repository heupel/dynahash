-------------
DynaHash extends Ruby's built-in Hash class instances to allow dot-notation
access to keys in the hash.

This is especially helpful in conjunction with the XmlSimple gem (gem install xml-simple)
Examples:
require 'rubygems'
require 'dynahash'

me = { 'First Name' => 'Tony', 'Last Name' => 'Heupel', :gender => :male }

me.first_name #   => 'Tony'
me.last_name  #   => 'Heupel'
me.gender     #   => :male
